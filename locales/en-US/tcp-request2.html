<script type="text/html" data-help-name="tcp request2">
    <p>A simple TCP request node( base on old <code>TCP request node</code>) - sends the <code>msg.payload</code> to a server tcp port and expects a response.</p>
    <p>Connects, sends the "request", and reads the "response". It can either count a number of
    returned characters into a fixed buffer, match a specified character before returning,
    wait a fixed timeout from first reply and then return, sit and wait for data, or send then close the connection
    immediately, without waiting for a reply.</p>
    <p>The response will be output in <code>msg.payload</code> as a buffer, so you may want to .toString() it.</p>
    <p>If you leave tcp host or port blank they must be set by using the <code>msg.host</code> and <code>msg.port</code> properties in every message sent to the node.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. You can specify the host and port in several ways.</li>
        <li>2. Add timeout settings with maxRetries. </li>
    </ul>
